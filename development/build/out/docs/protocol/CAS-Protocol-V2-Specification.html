<a id="2-cas-uris" class="anchor" href="#2-cas-uris" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. CAS URIs</h1>
<p>CAS is an HTTP[2,3]-based protocol that requires each of its components to be accessible through specific URIs.<br>
This section will discuss each of the URIs.</p>
<h2>
<a id="21-login-as-credential-requestor" class="anchor" href="#21-login-as-credential-requestor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.1. <em>/login</em> as credential requestor</h2>
<p>The <em>/login</em> URI operates with two behaviors: as a credential requestor, and as a credential acceptor. It responds<br>
to credentials by acting as a credential acceptor and otherwise acts as a credential requestor.</p>
<p>If the client has already established a single sign-on session with CAS, the web browser presents to CAS a secure<br>
cookie containing a string identifying a ticket-granting ticket. This cookie is called the ticket-granting cookie.<br>
If the ticket-granting cookie keys to a valid ticket-granting ticket, CAS may issue a service ticket provided all the<br>
other conditions in this specification are met. See Section 3.6 for more information on ticket-granting cookies.</p>
<h3>
<a id="211-parameters" class="anchor" href="#211-parameters" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.1.1. parameters</h3>
<p>The following HTTP request parameters may be passed to <em>/login</em> while it is acting as a credential requestor.<br>
They are all case-sensitive, and they all MUST be handled by <em>/login</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>service [OPTIONAL]</code> - the identifier of the application the client is trying to access. In almost all cases, this will<br>
be the URL of the application. Note that as an HTTP request parameter, this URL value MUST be URL-encoded as described<br>
in Section 2.2 of RFC 1738 [4]. If a service is not specified and a single sign-on session does not yet exist, CAS SHOULD<br>
request credentials from the user to initiate a single sign-on session. If a service is not specified and a single sign-on<br>
session already exists, CAS SHOULD display a message notifying the client that it is already logged in.</li>
<li>
<code>renew [OPTIONAL]</code> - if this parameter is set, single sign-on will be bypassed. In this case, CAS will require the client<br>
to present credentials regardless of the existence of a single sign-on session with CAS. This parameter is not compatible<br>
with the "gateway" parameter. Services redirecting to the <em>/login</em> URI and login form views posting to the <em>/login</em> URI<br>
SHOULD NOT set both the "renew" and "gateway" request parameters. Behavior is undefined if both are set. It is RECOMMENDED<br>
that CAS implementations ignore the "gateway" parameter if "renew" is set. It is RECOMMENDED that when the renew parameter<br>
is set itsvalue be "true".</li>
<li>
<code>gateway [OPTIONAL]</code> - if this parameter is set, CAS will not ask the client for credentials. If the client has a pre-existing<br>
single sign-on session with CAS, or if a single sign-on session can be established through non-interactive means<br>
(i.e. trust authentication), CAS MAY redirect the client to the URL specified by the "service" parameter, appending a valid<br>
service ticket. (CAS also MAY interpose an advisory page informing the client that a CAS authentication has taken place.)<br>
If the client does not have a single sign-on session with CAS, and a non-interactive authentication cannot be established, CAS<br>
MUST redirect the client to the URL specified by the "service" parameter with no "ticket" parameter appended to the URL.<br>
If the "service" parameter is not specified and "gateway" is set, the behavior of CAS is undefined. It is RECOMMENDED that in<br>
this case, CAS request credentials as if neither parameter was specified. This parameter is not compatible with the "renew"<br>
parameter. Behavior is undefined if both are set. It is RECOMMENDED that when the gateway parameter is set its value be "true".</li>
</ol>

<p>When <em>/login</em> behaves as a credential requestor, the response will vary depending on the type of credentials it is requesting.<br>
In most cases, CAS will respond by displaying a login screen requesting a username and password. This page MUST include a form<br>
with the parameters, "username", "password", and "lt". The form MAY also include the parameter, "warn". If "service" was<br>
specified to <em>/login</em>, "service" MUST also be a parameter of the form, containing the value originally passed to <em>/login</em>. These<br>
parameters are discussed in detail in Section 2.2.1. The form MUST be submitted through the HTTP POST method to <em>/login</em> which<br>
will then act as a credential acceptor, discussed in Section 2.2.</p>

<p>Trust authentication accommodates consideration of arbitrary aspects of the request as a basis for authentication.<br>
The appropriate user experience for trust authentication will be highly deployer-specific in consideration of local policy<br>
and of the logistics of the particular authentication mechanism implemented.</p>
<p>When <em>/login</em> behaves as a credential requestor for trust authentication, its behavior will be determined by the type of<br>
credentials it will be receiving. If the credentials are valid, CAS MAY transparently redirect the user to the service.<br>
Alternately, CAS MAY display a warning that credentials were presented and allow the client to confirm that it wants to use<br>
those credentials. It is RECOMMENDED that CAS implementations allow the deployer to choose the preferred behavior. If the<br>
credentials are invalid or non-existent, it is RECOMMENDED that CAS display to the client the reason authentication failed,<br>
and possibly present the user with alternate means of authentication (e.g. username/password authentication).</p>

<p>If the client has already established a single sign-on session with CAS, the client will have presented its HTTP session<br>
cookie to <em>/login</em> and behavior will be handled as in Section 2.2.4. However, if the "renew" parameter is set, the behavior will<br>
be handled as in Section 2.1.3 or 2.1.4.</p>

<p>The following HTTP request parameters MAY be passed to <em>/login</em> while it is acting as a credential acceptor. They are all<br>
case-sensitive and they all MUST be handled by <em>/login</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>service [OPTIONAL]</code> - the URL of the application the client is trying to access. CAS MUST redirect the client to this URL<br>
upon successful authentication. This is discussed in detail in Section 2.2.4.</li>
<li>
<code>warn [OPTIONAL]</code> - if this parameter is set, single sign-on MUST NOT be transparent. The client MUST be prompted before<br>

<p>In addition to the OPTIONAL parameters specified in Section 2.2.1, the following HTTP request parameters MUST be passed to<br>
<em>/login</em> while it is acting as a credential acceptor for username/password authentication. They are all case-sensitive.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>username [REQUIRED]</code> - the username of the client that is trying to log in</li>
<li>
<code>password [REQUIRED]</code> - the password of the client that is trying to log in</li>
<li>
<code>lt [REQUIRED]</code> - a login ticket. This is provided as part of the login form discussed in Section 2.1.3.<br>

<h3>
<a id="224-response" class="anchor" href="#224-response" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.2.4. response</h3>
<p>One of the following responses MUST be provided by /login when it is operating as a credential acceptor.</p>
<ol>
<li>successful login: redirect the client to the URL specified by the "service" parameter in a manner that will not cause<br>
the client's credentials to be forwarded to the service. This redirection MUST result in the client issuing a GET request<br>
to the service. The request MUST include a valid service ticket, passed as the HTTP request parameter, "ticket".<br>
See Appendix B for more information. If "service" was not specified, CAS MUST display a message notifying the client that<br>
it has successfully initiated a single sign-on session.</li>
<li>failed login: return to /login as a credential requestor. It is RECOMMENDED in this case that the CAS server display<br>
an error message be displayed to the user describing why login failed (e.g. bad password, locked account, etc.), and if<br>
appropriate, provide an opportunity for the user to attempt to login again.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
<a id="23-logout" class="anchor" href="#23-logout" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.3. <em>/logout</em>
</h2>
<p><em>/logout</em> destroys a client's single sign-on CAS session. The ticket-granting cookie (Section 3.6) is destroyed, and<br>
subsequent requests to <em>/login</em> will not obtain service tickets until the user again presents primary credentials<br>
(and thereby establishes a new single sign-on session).</p>
<h3>
<a id="231-parameters" class="anchor" href="#231-parameters" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.3.1. parameters</h3>
<p>The following HTTP request parameter MAY be specified to <em>/logout</em>. It is case sensitive and SHOULD be handled by <em>/logout</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>url [OPTIONAL] - if "url" is specified, the URL specified by "url" SHOULD be on the logout page with descriptive text.<br>
For example, "The application you just logged out of has provided a link it would like you to follow. Please click here to<br>
access <a href="http://www.go-back.edu">http://www.go-back.edu</a>."</li>
</ol>

<p><em>/logout</em> MUST display a page stating that the user has been logged out. If the "url" request parameter is implemented,<br>
<em>/logout</em> SHOULD also provide a link to the provided URL as described in Section 2.3.1.</p>

<p>The following values MAY be used as the "code" attribute of authentication failure responses. The following is the<br>
minimum set of error codes that all CAS servers MUST implement. Implementations MAY include others.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>INVALID_REQUEST</code> - not all of the required request parameters were present</li>
<li>
<code>INVALID_TICKET</code> - the ticket provided was not valid, or the ticket did not come from an initial login and "renew"<br>
was set on validation. The body of the <a href="cas:authenticationFailure">cas:authenticationFailure</a> block of the XML response SHOULD describe the exact<br>
details.</li>
<li>
<code>INVALID_SERVICE</code> - the ticket provided was valid, but the service specified did not match the service associated with<br>
the ticket. CAS MUST invalidate the ticket and disallow future validation of that same ticket.</li>
<li>
<code>INTERNAL_ERROR</code> - an internal error occurred during ticket validation</li>
</ol>
<p>For all error codes, it is RECOMMENDED that CAS provide a more detailed message as the body of the <code>&lt;cas:authenticationFailure&gt;</code><br>
block of the XML response.</p>
<h3>
<a id="254-proxy-callback" class="anchor" href="#254-proxy-callback" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.5.4. proxy callback</h3>
<p>If a service wishes to proxy a client's authentication to a back-end service, it must acquire a proxy-granting ticket.<br>
Acquisition of this ticket is handled through a proxy callback URL. This URL will uniquely and securely identify the back-end<br>
service that is proxying the client's authentication. The back-end service can then decide whether or not to accept the<br>
credentials based on the back-end service's identifying callback URL.</p>
<p>The proxy callback mechanism works as follows:</p>
<p>The service that is requesting a proxy-granting ticket specifies upon initial service ticket or proxy ticket validation the<br>
HTTP request parameter "pgtUrl" to <em>/serviceValidate</em> (or <em>/proxyValidate</em>). This is a callback URL of the service to which CAS<br>
will connect to verify the service's identity. This URL MUST be HTTPS, and CAS MUST verify both that the SSL certificate is<br>
valid and that its name matches that of the service. If the certificate fails validation, no proxy-granting ticket will be<br>
issued, and the CAS service response as described in Section 2.5.2 MUST NOT contain a <code>&lt;proxyGrantingTicket&gt;</code> block. At this<br>
point, the issuance of a proxy-granting ticket is halted, but service ticket validation will continue, returning success or<br>
failure as appropriate. If certificate validation is successful, issuance of a proxy-granting ticket proceeds as in step 2.<br>
CAS uses an HTTP GET request to pass the HTTP request parameters "pgtId" and "pgtIou" to the pgtUrl. These entities are<br>
discussed in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, respectively.</p>
<p>If the HTTP GET returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK), CAS MUST respond to the <em>/serviceValidate</em> (or <em>/proxyValidate</em>)<br>
request with a service response (Section 2.5.2) containing the proxy-granting ticket IOU (Section 3.4) within the<br>
<code>&lt;cas:proxyGrantingTicket&gt;</code> block. If the HTTP GET returns any other status code, excepting HTTP 3xx redirects, CAS MUST<br>
respond to the <em>/serviceValidate</em> (or <em>/proxyValidate</em>) request with a service response that MUST NOT contain a<br>
<code>&lt;cas:proxyGrantingTicket&gt;</code> block. CAS MAY follow any HTTP redirects issued by the pgtUrl. However, the identifying callback<br>
URL provided upon validation in the <code>&lt;proxy&gt;</code> block MUST be the same URL that was initially passed to <em>/serviceValidate</em><br>
(or <em>/proxyValidate</em>) as the "pgtUrl" parameter.</p>
<p>The service, having received a proxy-granting ticket IOU in the CAS response, and both a proxy-granting ticket and a<br>
proxy-granting ticket IOU from the proxy callback, will use the proxy-granting ticket IOU to correlate the proxy-granting<br>
ticket with the validation response. The service will then use the proxy-granting ticket for the acquisition of proxy<br>
tickets as described in Section 2.7.</p>

<p>Note that when authentication has proceeded through multiple proxies, the order in which the proxies were traversed<br>
MUST be reflected in the <a href="cas:proxies">cas:proxies</a> block. The most recently-visited proxy MUST be the first proxy listed, and all<br>
the other proxies MUST be shifted down as new proxies are added. In the above example, the service identified by<br>
<em><a href="https://proxy1/pgtUrl">https://proxy1/pgtUrl</a></em> was visited first, and that service proxied authentication to the service identified by<br>
<em><a href="https://proxy2/pgtUrl">https://proxy2/pgtUrl</a></em>.</p>

<a id="appendix-b-safe-redirection" class="anchor" href="#appendix-b-safe-redirection" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Appendix B: Safe redirection</h1>
<p>After a successful login, safely redirecting the client from CAS to its final destination must be handled with care.<br>
In most cases, the client has sent credentials to the CAS server over a POST request. By this specification, the CAS<br>
server must then forward the user to the application with a GET request.</p>
<p>The HTTP/1.1 RFC[3] provides a response code of 303: See Other, which provides for the desired behavior:<br>
a script that receives data through a POST request can, through a 303 redirection, forward the browser to another<br>
URL through a GET request. However, not all browsers have implemented this behavior correctly.</p>
<p>The recommended method of redirection is thus JavaScript. A page containing a window.location.href in the following<br>
manner performs adequately:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Yale Central Authentication Service&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            window.location.href="https://portal.yale.edu/Login?ticket=ST-..." mce_href="https://portal.yale.edu/Login?ticket=ST-...";
       &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;noscript&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CAS login successful.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;  Click &lt;a xhref="https://portal.yale.edu/Login?ticket=ST-..." mce_href="https://portal.yale.edu/Login?ticket=ST-..."&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
            to access the service you requested.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/noscropt&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, CAS should disable browser caching by setting all of the various cache-related headers:</p>
<pre><code>Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-store
Expires: [RFC 1123[6] date equal to or before now]
</code></pre>
<p>The introduction of the login ticket removed the possibility of CAS accepting credentials that were cached and replayed<br>
by a browser. However, early versions of Apple's Safari browser contained a bug where through usage of the Back button,<br>
Safari could be coerced into presenting the client's credentials to the service it is trying to access. CAS can prevent<br>
this behavior by not automatically redirecting if it detects that the remote browser is one of these early versions of<br>
Safari. Instead, CAS should display a page that states login was successful, and provide a link to the requested service.<br>
The client must then manually click to proceed.</p>
