<p>Enable support for the <em>Automatic Certificate Management Environment</em> (ACME) protocol<br>
as specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555">RFC 8555</a>. ACME is a protocol that a<br>
certificate authority (CA) such as Let's Encrypt and an applicant can use to automate the process<br>
of verification and certificate issuance.</p>
<p>Support is enabled by including the following dependency in the overlay:</p>
<p>{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-acme" %}</p>
<p>The activation of this module is performed on startup when the CAS server is ready serve http requests.<br>
When this module is finished successfully, the domain key pair composed of the key and<br>
the certificate (including the full certificate path) will be produced in separate files.</p>
<p>If no account was registered with the CA yet, there will also be a new key as the account key pair.</p>
<p>The CSR file contains the CSR that was used for the certificate order. It is generated for convenience<br>
and will not be needed later again. When the certificate is renewed, a new CSR will be generated.</p>
<p>There are two sets of key pairs. One is required for creating and accessing<br>
your account and the other is required for encrypting the traffic on your<br>
domain(s). It is strongly encouraged to use separate key pairs<br>
for account and each of the certificates.</p>

<a id="http-challenge" class="anchor" href="#http-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HTTP Challenge</h2>
<p>For the HTTP challenge, CAS server will respond to <code>GET</code> requests at<br>
<code>/.well-known/acme-challenge/{token}</code> path. The request is<br>
always performed against port <code>80</code> and at the root of the domain which<br>
means CAS MUST be able to operate at that port and context<br>
path to respond to verification challenges.</p>
