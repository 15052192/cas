<a id="installation-requirements" class="anchor" href="#installation-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation Requirements</h1>
<p>Depending on choice of configuration components, there may be additional requirements such as LDAP directory,<br>
database, and caching infrastructure. In most cases, however, requirements should be self evident to deployers who<br>
choose components with clear hardware and software dependencies. In any case where additional requirements are<br>
not obvious, the discussion of component configuration should mention system, software, hardware, and other<br>
requirements.</p>

<a id="java" class="anchor" href="#java" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Java</h2>
<p>CAS at its heart is a Java-based web application. Prior to deployment,<br>
you will need to have <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/">JDK</a> <code>11</code> installed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The key part of the license is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may not: use the Programs for any data processing or any commercial, production, or internal business purposes other than developing, testing, prototyping, and demonstrating your Application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> download or use the Oracle JDK unless you intend to pay for it. <strong>Use an OpenJDK build instead.</strong></p>
<h2>
<a id="servlet-containers" class="anchor" href="#servlet-containers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Servlet Containers</h2>
<p>There is no officially supported servlet container for CAS, but <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a> is the most<br>
commonly used. Support for a particular servlet container depends on the expertise of community members.</p>
<p>See <a href="../installation/Configuring-Servlet-Container.html">this guide</a> for more info.</p>
<h2>
<a id="build-tools" class="anchor" href="#build-tools" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build Tools</h2>
<p>WAR overlays are <a href="../installation/WAR-Overlay-Installation.html">provided</a> to allow for a straightforward and flexible<br>
deployment solution. While it admittedly requires a high up-front cost in learning, it reaps numerous benefits in the long run.</p>

<h2>
<a id="git-optional" class="anchor" href="#git-optional" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git (Optional)</h2>
<p>While not strictly a requirement, it's HIGHLY recommended that you have <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> installed for your CAS deployment,<br>
and manage all CAS artifacts, configuration files, build scripts and setting inside a source control repository.</p>
<h2>
<a id="os" class="anchor" href="#os" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OS</h2>
<p>No particular preference on the operating system, though Linux-based installs are typically more common than Windows.</p>
<h2>
<a id="internet-connectivity" class="anchor" href="#internet-connectivity" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internet Connectivity</h2>
<p>Internet connectivity is generally required for the build phase of any Maven/Gradle based project, including the<br>
recommended WAR overlays used to install CAS. The build process resolves dependencies by searching online repositories<br>
containing artifacts (jar files in most cases) that are downloaded and installed locally.</p>
<h2>
<a id="hardware" class="anchor" href="#hardware" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hardware</h2>
<p>Anecdotal community evidence seems to suggest that CAS deployments would perform well on a dual-core 3.00Ghz<br>
processor with 8GB of memory, at a minimum. Enough disk space (preferably SSD) is also needed to house CAS-generated logs, if logs are kept on the server itself.</p>
<p>Remember that the above requirements are <em>suggestions</em>. You may get by perfectly fine with more or less,<br>
depending on your deployment and request volume. Start with the bare minimum and be prepared to adjust and strengthen capacity on demand if needed.</p>
