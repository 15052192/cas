<h1>
<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h1>
<p>This document provides a high-level guide on how to get started with a CAS server deployment.<br>
The sole focus of the guide is describe the process<br>
that must be followed and adopted by CAS deployers in order to arrive at a successful<br>
and sustainable architecture and deployment.</p>
<h2>
<a id="collect-use-cases" class="anchor" href="#collect-use-cases" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collect Use Cases</h2>
<p>It is very important that you document, catalog and analyze your desired use cases and requirements prior to the deployment.<br>
Once you have a few ideas, please discuss and share those with the <a href="/cas/Support.html">CAS community</a><br>
to learn about common trends, practices and patterns<br>
that may already have solved the same issues you face today.</p>

<h2>
<a id="study-architecture" class="anchor" href="#study-architecture" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Study Architecture</h2>
<p>Understand what CAS is and can do. This will help you develop a foundation to realize which of your use cases<br>
and requirements may already be possible with CAS. Take a look at the fundamentals<br>
of the <a href="Architecture.html">CAS architecture</a><br>
to see what options and choices might be available for deployments and application integrations.</p>
<p>Likewise, it's equally important that you study the list of<br>
CAS <a href="../protocol/Protocol-Overview.html">supported protocols and specifications</a>.</p>
<h2>
<a id="review-blog" class="anchor" href="#review-blog" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Review Blog</h2>
<p>From time to time, blog posts appears on the <a href="https://apereo.github.io/">Apereo Blog</a><br>
that might become useful as you are thinking about requirements and evaluating features.<br>
It is generally recommended that you follow the blog and keep up with project news and<br>
announcements as much as possible, and do not shy away from writing and contributing your own blog posts, experiences and updates throughout your CAS deployment.</p>
<h2>
<a id="prepare-environment" class="anchor" href="#prepare-environment" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prepare Environment</h2>
<p>Study the <a href="Installation-Requirements.html">installation requirements</a> for the deployment environment.</p>
<h2>
<a id="deploy-cas" class="anchor" href="#deploy-cas" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deploy CAS</h2>
<p>It is recommended to build and deploy CAS locally using the <a href="../installation/WAR-Overlay-Installation.html">WAR Overlay method</a>.<br>
This approach does not require the adopter to <em>explicitly</em> download any version of CAS, but<br>
rather utilizes the overlay mechanism to combine CAS original artifacts and local<br>
customizations to further ease future upgrades and maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Do NOT clone or download the CAS codebase directly. That is ONLY required if you<br>
wish to contribute to the development of the project.</p>
<p>It is <strong>VERY IMPORTANT</strong> that you try to get a functional baseline working before doing anything else.<br>
Avoid making ad-hoc changes right away to customize the deployment. Stick with the CAS-provided defaults<br>
and settings and make changes <strong>one step at a time</strong>. Keep track of process and applied changes<br>
in source control and tag changes as you make progress.</p>
<h2>
<a id="customize" class="anchor" href="#customize" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customize</h2>
<p>This is where use cases get mapped to CAS features. Browse the documentation to find the closest match and apply.<br>
Again, it is important that you stick with the CAS baseline as much as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid making ad-hoc changes to the software internals.</li>
<li>Avoid making manual changes to core configuration components such as Spring and Spring Webflow.</li>
<li>Avoid making one-off bug fixes to the deployment, should you encounter an issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>As noted previously, all such strategies lead to headache and cost.</p>
<p>Instead, try to warm up to the following suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug fixes and small improvements belong to the core CAS software. Not your deployment. Make every attempt to report issues,<br>
contribute fixes and patches and work with the CAS community to solve issues once and for all.</li>
<li>Certain number of internal CAS components are made difficult to augment and modify. In most cases, this approach is<br>
done on purpose to steer you away from dangerous and needlessly complicated changes. If you come across a need<br>
and have a feature or use case in mind whose configuration and implementation requires modifications to the core internals<br>
of the software, discuss that with the CAS community and attempt to build the enhancement directly into the CAS software,<br>
rather than treating it as a snowflake.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, only make changes to the deployment configuration if they are truly and completely specific to your needs.<br>
Otherwise, try to generalize and contribute back to keep maintenance costs down.<br>
Repeatedly, failure to comply with this strategy<br>
will likely lead to disastrous results in the long run.</p>

<p>The <a href="../installation/Troubleshooting-Guide.html">troubleshooting guide</a> might have some answers<br>
for issues you may have run into and it generally tries to describe a strategy useful for troubleshooting<br>
and diagnostics. You may also seek assistance from the <a href="/cas/Mailing-Lists.html">CAS community</a>.</p>
