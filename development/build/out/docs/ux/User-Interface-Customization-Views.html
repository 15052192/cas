<h1>
<a id="views" class="anchor" href="#views" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Views</h1>
<p>The views are found inside the CAS web application in the <code>WEB-INF\lib\cas-server-support-thymeleaf-&lt;cas.version&gt;.jar</code> in the<br>
templates folder. Add any views that require customization to the <code>src/main/resources/templates</code> folder in the CAS overlay project.<br>
Any files found in that module can be overridden by putting them in the same location under<br>
<code>src/main/resources</code> in the CAS overlay project. The Gradle build script for the overlay has tasks that help get resources<br>
from the CAS web application to the correct location in the CAS overlay.</p>
<p>Views also may be externalized outside the web application conditionally and individually, provided the external path<br>
via CAS settings. If a view template file is not found at the externalized path, the default one that ships with CAS will be used as the fallback.</p>
<p>Views may also be found using an external URL in CAS settings that is responsible to produce the full view body in<br>
the response. This URL endpoint will receive the available request headers as well as the following headers in its request:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Header</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>owner</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>template</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>resource</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>theme</code>, if available</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>locale</code>, if available</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Upon a successful <code>200</code> status result, the response body is expected to contain the view that will be rendered by CAS.</p>

<a id="thymeleaf" class="anchor" href="#thymeleaf" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Thymeleaf</h2>
<p>CAS uses <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org">Thymeleaf</a> for its markup rendering engine. Each template is decorated by <code>layout.html</code> template file, which provides a layout structure for the template's content. Individual components optimized for re-use among multiple templates are stored in the <code>src/main/resources/templates/fragments</code> folder, and referenced by the templates in <code>src/main/resources/templates</code>.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf documentation</a> for more information on its use and syntax.</p>

<a id="warning-before-accessing-application" class="anchor" href="#warning-before-accessing-application" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Warning Before Accessing Application</h2>
<p>CAS has the ability to warn the user before being redirected to the service. This allows users to be made aware whenever an application uses CAS to log them in.<br>
(If they don't elect the warning, they may not see any CAS screen when accessing an application that successfully relies upon an existing CAS single sign-on session.)<br>
Some CAS adopters remove the 'warn' checkbox in the CAS login view and don't offer this interstitial advisement that single sign-on is happening.</p>
<pre lang="html"><code>...
&lt;input id="warn"
       name="warn"
       value="true"
       tabindex="3"
       th:accesskey="#{screen.welcome.label.warn.accesskey}"
       type="checkbox" /&gt;
&lt;label for="warn" th:utext="#{screen.welcome.label.warn}"/&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<a id="custom-fields" class="anchor" href="#custom-fields" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Custom Fields</h2>
<p>CAS allows on the ability to dynamically extend the login form by including additional fields, to be populated by the user.<br>
Such fields are taught to CAS using settings and are then bound to the authentication flow and made available to all<br>
authentication handlers that wish to impose additional processes and rules using said fields.</p>
