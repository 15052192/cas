<p>Upon startup and configuration permitting, the registry is able to auto initialize itself from default JSON service definitions available to CAS. Populating the registry with a set of default services serves as <em>a starting point</em> and an example at that where one is able to immediately start integrating applications. For production purposes, it is recommended that you pick a more relevant <a href="Service-Management.html">option for storage</a> and disable this behavior.</p>
<p>The default service definitions that are used by the initializer component ship with CAS by default and are put on the classpath. The initializer is able to detect all service definitions files found on the classpath (i.e. <code>src/main/resources/services</code>) and import them into the <em>real</em> service registry used. This means that if this behavior is enabled and additional files are found on the classpath at the relevant paths, CAS will take the default services as well as any and all other services found in order to import them into the service registry used. Note that the location of the JSON files while typically set to the classpath may be controlled via CAS properties; The same setting property that controls the location of the JSON service files for the JSON service registry is used by the initialization logic to locate service files.</p>
<p>Again, this behavior is only useful as a starting point, an example and for small and specialized deployments. It is recommended that you take explicit control over the registry and register services and applications which you have fully authorized.
