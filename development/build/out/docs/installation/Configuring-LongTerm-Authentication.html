<p>This feature, also known as <em>Remember Me</em>, extends the length of the SSO session beyond the typical period of hours<br>
such that users can go days or weeks without having to log in to CAS. See the<br>
<a href="../planning/Security-Guide.html">security guide</a><br>
for discussion of security concerns related to long term authentication.</p>

<p>While users can elect to establish a long term authentication session, the duration is established through<br>
configuration as a matter of security policy. Deployers must determine the length of long term authentication sessions<br>
by weighing convenience against security risks.</p>
<p>The use of long term authentication sessions dramatically increases the length of time ticket-granting tickets are<br>
stored in the ticket registry. Loss of a ticket-granting ticket corresponding to a long-term SSO session would require<br>
the user to re-authenticate to CAS. A security policy that requires that long term authentication sessions MUST NOT<br>
be terminated prior to their natural expiration would mandate a ticket<br>
registry component that provides for durable storage, such as the <a href="../ticketing/JPA-Ticket-Registry.html">JPA Ticket Registry</a>.</p>

<a id="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration</h2>
<p>Adjust your expiration policy so that remember-me authentication requests are<br>
handled via a long-term timeout expiration policy, and other requests<br>
are handled via the CAS default SSO session expiration policy.</p>
