<p>This handler uses the request's remote address to transparently authenticate a user, having verified<br>
the address against a range of configured IP addresses. The mechanics of this approach are very similar<br>
to X.509 certificate authentication, but trust is instead placed on the client internal network address.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is that transparent authentication is achieved within a large corporate<br>
network without the need to manage certificates.</p>

<a id="caveats" class="anchor" href="#caveats" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Caveats</h2>
<p>This method of authentication assumes internal clients will be hitting the CAS server directly<br>
and not coming via a web proxy. In the event of the client using the web proxy the likelihood<br>
of the remote address lookup succeeding is reduced because to CAS the client address is that<br>
of the proxy server and not the client. Given that this form of CAS authentication would typically<br>
be deployed within an internal network this is generally not a problem.</p>
