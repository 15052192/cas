<p>Each release of CAS provides a curated list of dependencies it supports. In practice, you do not need<br>
to provide a version for any of these dependencies in your build configuration as the CAS distribution is managing that for you.<br>
When you upgrade CAS itself, these dependencies will be upgraded as well in a consistent way.</p>
<p>The curated list of dependencies contains a refined list of third party libraries. The list is<br>
available as a standard Bills of Materials (BOM). Not everyone likes inheriting from the BOM.<br>
You may have your own corporate standard parent that you need to use, or<br>
you may just prefer to explicitly declare all your configuration.</p>
<p>Support for BOM is enabled by including the following dependency in the WAR overlay:</p>
<p>{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-bom" ignoreBOM="true" %}</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.spring.dependency-management">use this guide</a><br>
and configure the Gradle build accordingly.</p>
<p>Please note that the <a href="WAR-Overlay-Initializr.html">CAS Initializr</a> is preconfigured to use the CAS BOM.</p>
