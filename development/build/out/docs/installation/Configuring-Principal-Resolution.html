title: CAS - Configuring Principal Resolution<br>
category: Configuration</h2>
<h1>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h1>
<p>Principal resolution converts information in the authentication credential into a security principal<br>
that commonly contains additional<br>
metadata attributes (i.e. user details such as affiliations, group membership, email, display name).</p>
<p>A CAS principal contains a unique identifier by which the authenticated user will be known to all requesting<br>
services. A principal also contains optional <a href="../integration/Attribute-Release.html">attributes that may be released</a><br>
to services to support authorization and personalization. Principal resolution is a requisite part of the<br>
authentication process that happens after credential authentication.</p>
<p>CAS <code>AuthenticationHandler</code> components provide basic principal resolution machinery by default. For example,<br>
the <code>LdapAuthenticationHandler</code> component supports fetching attributes and setting the principal ID attribute from<br>
an LDAP query. In all cases principals are resolved from the same store as that which provides authentication.</p>
<p>In many cases it is necessary to perform authentication by one means and resolve principals by another.<br>
The <code>PrincipalResolver</code> component provides this functionality. A common use case for this this mix-and-match strategy<br>
arises with X.509 authentication. It is common to store certificates in an LDAP directory and query the directory to<br>
resolve the principal ID and attributes from directory attributes. The <code>X509CertificateAuthenticationHandler</code> may<br>
be be combined with an LDAP-based principal resolver to accommodate this case.</p>

<p>CAS uses the Person Directory library to provide a flexible principal resolution services against a number of data<br>
sources. The key to configuring <code>PersonDirectoryPrincipalResolver</code> is the definition of an <code>IPersonAttributeDao</code> object.</p>

<a id="principalresolver-vs-authenticationhandler" class="anchor" href="#principalresolver-vs-authenticationhandler" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PrincipalResolver vs. AuthenticationHandler</h2>
<p>The principal resolution machinery provided by <code>AuthenticationHandler</code> components should be used in preference to<br>
<code>PrincipalResolver</code> in any situation where the former provides adequate functionality.<br>
If the principal that is resolved by the authentication handler<br>
suffices, then a <code>null</code> value may be passed in place of the resolver bean id in the final map.</p>
