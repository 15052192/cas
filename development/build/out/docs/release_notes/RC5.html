<p>We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a <code>GA</code> release is only going to set<br>
you up for unpleasant surprises. A <code>GA</code> is <a href="https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/">a tag and nothing more</a>. Note that CAS<br>
releases are <em>strictly</em> time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain<br>
confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with<br>
release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.</p>

<p>If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we<br>
invite you to <a href="https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership">join the Apereo Foundation</a><br>
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity<br>
is performed <em>almost exclusively</em> on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better<br>
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate <em>dedicated and committed</em> time for long-term support,<br>
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner. Funding will<br>
ensure support for the software you rely on and you gain an advantage and say in the way Apereo, and the CAS project at that, runs<br>
and operates. If you consider your CAS deployment to be a critical part of the identity and access<br>
management ecosystem, this is a viable option to consider.</p>
